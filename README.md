🎆 Diwali Sales Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Diwali sales data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover customer purchase behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The dataset includes demographic details, purchase quantities, and sales amounts.

The goal is to clean, transform, and visualize the data to provide actionable insights that can help optimize festive season sales strategies.

🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze Diwali sales transactions, identify key revenue drivers, and understand customer buying patterns during the festive season. The analysis aims to support business decision-making, targeted marketing, and product strategy improvements.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python – Data cleaning & analysis

Pandas – Data wrangling & preprocessing

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization

Excel / CSV – Raw dataset

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

Removed duplicates and null values, reducing inconsistencies by 90%+.

Standardized column names and converted datatypes (Amount, Orders, Quantity).

Filtered out invalid and non-positive transaction values.

Final dataset size reduced from 11K+ records to a clean, analysis-ready dataset.
